# Backend-creation-test
In this repository i would be creating and using backends with MongoDb.



## Steps i took
- npm init -y :in the root
- then npm install(express, mongoose and dotenv)
- then created server.js file in the backend, this serves as the entry point for the API


## Nodemon
It helps devlop nodejs based applications by automatically restarting node application when file changes in the directory are detected
(source npm nodemon)
Basically saves you the hassle of restarting nodejs application anytime you make a change.
